## Known Issues / Errors

| Issue | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Installation Failure on Some Devices | APKs may fail to install if `package name` conflicts with existing ones or if APK is unsigned. |
| No Real-Time Clone Launch Isolation | Currently, launching multiple cloned apps does not provide sandbox isolation â€” only separate installable packages. |
| No Signature Handling | APKs are reinstalled but not re-signed after renaming. This may block installs on stricter Android versions. |

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Tech |
|-------|------|
| UI | Flutter |
| Backend | Java (Android) |
| Communication | Flutter `MethodChannel` |
| Permissions | Android `ActivityCompat` and `Settings` Intent |
| APK Tools | Android PackageManager, Java File I/O |


## Improvements

- Requires a search bar for both projects and files for easy access to required files.
- Need to add the linking functionality to the WebPage both via individual projects and direct opening.
- Application can either implement a linked database for both the webpage and application for easy access to modifed apk without additional downloads.
- Need to improve general UI of the application.
